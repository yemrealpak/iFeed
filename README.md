iFeed: Smart Animal Feeding and Tracking System
iFeed is a prototype project developed for a smart animal feeding and tracking system. This system evaluates images of animals, determines their species, and automatically feeds them. Additionally, it detects dangerous animals and generates relevant notifications. Various design patterns such as Mediator, Serverless, Builder, and Decorator are used in the project.

Features
Processing images of incoming animals to determine their species and numbers
Detecting dangerous animals and generating relevant notifications
Automatically feeding animals
Providing user interfaces for personnel and government officials
Technologies Used
OpenCV for image processing
AWS services for serverless application
SQL database (AWS Aurora serverless engine PostgreSQL) for database management
React for interface development
This project can be used to monitor and control animal populations in smart city systems. For more information, please explore the project or get in touch.
